# Matrix Task :
- In this project we have created a 3x3 matrix with 9 square boxes. 

- By default every box will have white color as background.

- When clicked on a box in the matrix, its colour will change to red, and on clicking again, the color will change to green and click again, its colour will be the defult.

- Ultimately the box background color will have 3 phases -> white to red, red to green, green to white.
